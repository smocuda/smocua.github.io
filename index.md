## SmoCuDa - The Open Smoking Cue Database

### About

SmoCuDa is a free open access database of 250 smoking-related images. All images were taken from open and free-to-use photo websites (creative commons license) and were chosen to cover a widespread variety of cigarette-associated content (e.g. cigarettes, ashtrays, smokers of different ages and genders). Further, all images have been rated, tested and validated by, to date, 40 mild to heavy smokers. These ratings demonstrate that SmoCuDa images cover a wide range of intensities along the stimulus dimensions "craving", "arousal", and "valence". Thus, SmoCuDa images are suited particularly well to investigate cue-induced behavior and neural activity over a large continuum of intensities.

### Reference

More detailed information on image ratings, cross-validations with other image databases (International Affective Picture System; and International Smoking Image Series), and on image-driven brain activity will soon be published. Please contact us for any questions prior to publication (amelie.haugg(AT)uzh.ch, andrei.manoliu(AT)puk.zh.ch, frank.scharnowski(AT)uzh.ch).

## Documentation

### Participants

SmoCuDa images were rated by 40 smokers (age = 26.12±5.74 years; 20 females, 19 males, 1 non-binary; cigarettes/day = 12.58±5.84; smoking duration = 7.2±4.66 years).

### Ratings

Information on image ratings can be downloaded <a href="https://osf.io/78ya4/">here</a>. Further information on image ratings and the image rating process will be made available after publication. Please contact us for any questions prior to publication.

### Cross-validation with other image databases

Cross-validations with oter image databases will be put online after publication. Please contact us for any questions prior to publication.
