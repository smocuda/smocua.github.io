## SmoCuDa - The Open Smoking Cue Database

### About

SmoCuDa is a free open access database of 250 smoking-related images. All images were taken from open and free-to-use photo websites (creative commons license) and were chosen to cover a widespread variety of cigarette-associated content (e.g. cigarettes, ashtrays, smokers of different ages and genders). Further, all images have been rated, tested and validated by, to date, 40 mild to heavy smokers. These ratings demonstrate that SmoCuDa images cover a wide range of intensities along the stimulus dimensions "craving", "arousal", and "valence". Thus, SmoCuDa images are suited particularly well to investigate cue-induced behavior and neural activity over a large continuum of intensities.

## Documentation

### Participants

SmoCuDa images were rated by 40 smokers (age = 26.12±5.74 years; 20 females, 19 males, 1 non-binary; cigarettes/day = 12.58±5.84; smoking duration = 7.2±4.66 years).

### Ratings

An EXCEL file with information on image ratings can be downloaded <a href="https://osf.io/78ya4/">here</a>. Further information on image ratings are available in the SmoCuDa <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509758">manuscript</a> and our Open Science Framework <a href="https://osf.io/6gwy5/">project folder</a>. 

### Cross-validation with other image databases

Cross-validations with other image databases are quickly discussed in the SmoCuDa <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509758">manuscript</a>, with more detailed information available in the Supplemntal Material.
